# Random Password Generator

This Python script generates a random password based on user input for the desired password length. It combines lowercase letters, uppercase letters, digits, and punctuation characters to create a secure password.

## Features
- Generates passwords with customizable lengths.
- Uses a combination of:
  - Lowercase letters (a-z)
  - Uppercase letters (A-Z)
  - Digits (0-9)
  - Punctuation characters (e.g., `!@#$%^&*()`)

## Requirements
- Python 3.x

## How to Use

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the script in your favorite Python environment.
3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python password_generator.py
   ```
4. Enter the desired password length when prompted.
5. The script will display a randomly generated password.

## Example Usage:
Enter password Length

12

Your password is: 

g7%kQ@zP1Lf!

## Code Explanation
The script works as follows:

  - It imports necessary libraries:
    
    - **string**: To access predefined character sets like lowercase letters, uppercase letters, digits, and punctuation.
    - **random**: To shuffle the list of characters and create randomness.

  - The script prompts the user to input the desired password length.

  - It then creates a list of all possible characters by extending lists of:
    - Lowercase letters: **string.ascii_lowercase**
    
    - Uppercase letters: **string.ascii_uppercase**
    
    - Digits: **string.digits**
    
    - Punctuation: **string.punctuation**

  - The list is shuffled randomly using **random.shuffle()**, and a password of the requested length is generated by joining the first **plen** characters from the shuffled list.
